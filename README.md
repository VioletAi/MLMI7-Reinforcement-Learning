# MLMI7 Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making Coursework

## Overview
This project is part of the MLMI7 Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making coursework. It involves implementing basic building-blocks of Reinforcement Learning in Python for a discrete grid-world model. 

## Project Files
- `model.py`: Constructs the grid worlds.
- `world_config.py`: Configuration for world dynamics.
- `plot_vp.py`: Visualizes values and policies.
- `policy_iteration.py`: Demonstrates usage of the model and plotting code.

## Environments
- `small_world`: Basic grid world.
- `grid_world`: Standard grid world with more complex dynamics.
- `cliff_world`: Grid world where stepping off the cliff resets the agent to the start state.

## Installation
To set up this project, clone this repository and install the required Python libraries.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
